# AR-Labyrinth

AR-Labyrinth was a project for the Fall 2016 5C Hackathon which won first place in the advanced division. A video demo of the game may be found [here](https://youtu.be/P58ffI9cnCg).

AR Labyrinth is a modern take on the classic game Labyrinth. Users can draw their own maze and then scan it into the game. To provide a tactile input similar to the original game, the player can hold the physical map under a webcam and tilt it to control the virtual ball. AR Labyrinth uses OpenCV's feature detection to compute homographies that track the tilt of the map in the webcam stream, and Panda3D as a 3D physics engine to generate user created maps and run the game.

## Setting up the Game

The OpenCV and Panda3D modules will be required to play this game. OpenCV will need to be run in Anaconda Python 2.7 version, which can be installed [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Panda3D will need to be installed by installing Panda3D's own package of Python, which can be installed [here](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php).

### Setting up OpenCV

Install Anaconda Python 2.7 version through the [website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). If you had previously installed Anaconda Python 3.5 version or would like to install the newer version instead for future use, you may switch to the 2.7 version with the command

```bash
source activate python2
```

If you would like to switch back to Python 3.5, you may use the command

```bash
source deactivate
```

To install OpenCV in Anaconda, use the command

```bash
conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.1.0
```

### Setting up Panda3D

Install the Panda3D SDK from the [website](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php). A version of Python 3.5 called `ppython` is installed with the SDK and will be required for the game to work.

# Playing the Game

Start by running the following command.

```bash
python2 scan_maze.py
```

A live webcam feed will show up in a new window. Position the map so it is on the screen and press `c` to capture a still frame of the map. Crop the image so that the map fills up the entire window. The live webcam feed will then return.

Then, run the following command.

```bash
ppython run_game.py
```

A new window will show up containing the maze generated by the map. Tilting the map results in the virtual ball moving around the virtual labyrinth.
